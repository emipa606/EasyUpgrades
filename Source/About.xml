&lt;size=24&gt;What it do??&lt;/size&gt;
&lt;size=12&gt;(a horrible misuse of the colloquial phrase, I know)&lt;/size&gt;

&lt;size=18&gt;With this mod, you can:&lt;/size&gt;
- Easily upgrade or downgrade buildings without needing to deconstruct them first. The resource cost remains the same. (e.g. a fueled stove normally takes 80 steel, while an electric stove takes 80 steel plus 2 components. So in order to upgrade from a fueled stove to an electric stove, all you need is the difference, which in this case is 2 components.) When downgrading a building, it refunds the difference. Additionally, if there's any remaining fuel left in a building when you upgrade it, that fuel will also be refunded.
- Attempt to increase the quality of items, apparel, and sculptures. This will depend on the pawn's skill level in the given category. With every attempt there's a chance of success, failure, and nothing happening. These chance values can be modified in the mod settings.

&lt;size=24&gt;What you can upgrade/downgrade&lt;/size&gt;
- Fueled stove &lt;--&gt; Electric stove
- Fueled smithy &lt;--&gt; Electric smithy
- Hand tailoring bench &lt;--&gt; Electric tailoring bench
- Wood generator &lt;--&gt; Chemfuel generator
- Door &lt;--&gt; Autodoor
- Possibly more in the future...

&lt;size=20&gt;Things you can increase quality for&lt;/size&gt;
- Weapons
- Apparel
- Sculptures
- Buildings (like beds) that have a quality to them

&lt;size=18&gt;Known bugs&lt;/size&gt;
- Sometimes when increasing the quality of an item, the resources used don't actually get used. (I like to think of this as a "happy accident")
